study and plot the radiation pattern of folded dipole antenna.

Folded antenna is a dipole antenna with the ends folded back around and connected
to each other, forming a loop as shown in Figure 1.

Typically, the width d of the folded dipole antenna is much smaller than the length
L, because the folded dipole forms a closed loop, one might expect the input
impedance to depend on the input impedance of a short-circuited transmission line
of length L. However, you can imagine the folded dipole antenna as two parallel
short-circuited transmission lines of length L/2 (separated at the midpoint by the feed
in Figure 1). It turns out the impedance of the folded dipole antenna will be a function
of the impedance of a transmission line of length L/2. Also, because the folded dipole
is "folded" back on itself, the currents can reinforce each other instead of cancelling
each other out, so the input impedance will also depend on the impedance of a dipole

antenna of length L. The folded dipole antenna is resonant and radiates well at odd
integer multiples of a half wavelength (0.5位, 1.5位, ...), when the antenna is fed in the
centre as shown in Figure 2. The input impedance of the folded dipole is higher than
that for a regular dipole. The folded dipole antenna can be made resonant at even
multiples of a half-wavelength (1.0位, 2.0 位,...) by offsetting the feed of the folded
dipole in Figure 2 (closer to the top or bottom edge of the folded dipole).
